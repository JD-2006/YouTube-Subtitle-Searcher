# YouTube-Subtitle-Searcher
Download and search all of the video subtitles on a channel/creator

A Linux and Windows program that creates a folder named as the channel name and downloads all the videos subtitles then asks user for a search term and if found displays the name of the videos subtitle.

The Windows versions window automatically closes if no results are found.

Some of the transcriptions are not always accurate so keep that in mind. Also it checks only for english subs, so edit if need be for your language.

It is slow AF so even though it re-checks for already downloaded subs it takes a while.
